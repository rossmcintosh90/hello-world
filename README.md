# hello-world
Just another repository

First look at github as part of CS50 week 0.
Actuary based in Leeds UK, totally new to programming, but looking to learn as much as possible!
Have done a small amount of VBA programming as part of my job, but very limited. 
Live with my girlfriend Ailsa and currently trying to move to Australia (but having visa issues!)

Hoping to learn as much as possible that will hopefully further my career and let me work on some fun ideas!
